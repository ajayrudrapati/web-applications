	<h2>About Me</h2> 
	<p> Greetings! Im Rudrapati Ajay Satya Sahit and I am 25 years old and I am from south India (Andhra pradesh).I have completed my Bachelors in Computer Science at Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University (JNTU) in the year 2021.Currently Im pursuing my Masters in Computer science at Depaul University,Chicago,Illinois.
The biggest influence I've had growing up was my grandfather who always impressed upon me the need to strive to be the best version of myself.After assimilating solid fundamentals from one of the top institutes in India, I wanted to pursue a graduate degree to delve deeper into the advanced constructs of Computer Science.I think the elite and conductive  environment of Depaul University will propel me to realize my professional goals.
With every single course I took, I was inspired and enthralled by the power that the stream of Computer Science exercised. I have been lucky enough to be surrounded by brilliant and dedicated professors whose profundity acted as a catalyst in accelerating my learning curve. I have completed my undergraduation with strong academics and a GPA of 7.46.
In the final year of my undergraduation , I pursued my interest in research by starting out on a project to learn and get hands-on experience.  As part of the curriculum's major project, I teamed up with a close friend of mine to built an IOS application called chauffeur.Chauffeur is an online driver booking application for people who dont know driving.
I dont have any work experience as I have planned my Masters as soon as i have completed my Bachelors.
My academic record reflects my persistence, determination and potential in the field of Computer Science. I am enthusiastic and passionate about the Master's program and the holistic courses it has to offer. I would be truly honored to bring my diligence to develop a successful symbiotic relation with the university.
My ambition is to become a professional in computer science working with Multi national companies (MNC),when I return to my home country.
When it comes to my personal interests,Im fond of playing cricket and watching movies in my spare time.
and recently I have watched John wick episode 4 which was an out and out entertainer and I have enjoyed it a lot.
When it comes to family,We are a family of four members,my father and mother are government employees and I have a younger brother who is currently pursuing his bachelors in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science.
Hailing from a middle class family in India, a computer was a rare resource. I remember picking  fights with my cousin brother, who would hog the computer most of the time for his homework or to take part in programming contests. I was curious to understand what was more exciting than playing video games on the brand new computer. He explained to me how programming creates these video games. This immediately piqued my interest and I asked him to tell me more. After seeing how a math problem could be solved using just a few lines of code, I was mesmerized and started learning more about coding and computers. The more I explored, the more I fell in love with the idea of emulating and solving real life scenarios.

	<p class="card-text">Chauffeur is an online driver booking application. It was built to hire an unemployed person to drive a private or hired car through mobile to avoid road accidents. Background check is done for every driver before approving their application into the app. Any negative traffic reviews or bad performances on the driver in the past will be considered strictly and never let the driver to be employed. The main benefit of this application is to provide employment opportunities to several people, to reduce drunk and drive, rash driving accidents, mostly suitable to people who don't know how to drive.</p>

	<p class="card-text">A movie recommendation system is a software application that helps users get their personalized movies recommended on the basis of their interests and liking. This can be a practical application that can help people also this can be the best way to implement your machine learning knowledge and learn in-depth about machine learning that how the algorithms actually work. This project uses Machine learning algorithms to analyze the reviews, watch time, ratings, etc. to generate recommendations. 
The user interface can be made more attractive in order to enhance engagement on the app. There might have functionalities like user accounts, searching, filtering, rating system, etc. that allows users not only to get recommendation but also to rate the movies that help others.</p>
